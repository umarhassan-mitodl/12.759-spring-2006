Course Meeting Times
--------------------

Lectures: 1 session / week, 1.5 hours / session

Outline
-------

The structure of the course is designed to have students acquire a broad understanding of the field of Marine Chemistry; to get a feel for experimental methodologies, the results that they have generated and the theoretical insights they have yielded to date. Each student is also responsible for chairing class discussions on one of the assigned readings. There are no exams.

Prerequisites
-------------

Marine Chemistry

Student Presentation
--------------------

Each student is required to give a presentation on one of the papers covered in the class. The presentation should address the background of the paper as well as provide a non critical summary, critical evaluation, and discussion of the findings.

Grading
-------

Students are assigned a pass or fail grade based on two factors: The quality of their presentations (as indicated by its comprehensiveness, critical evaluation of the assigned paper, and the students' skill in ascertaining the paper's significance), as well as the extent and quality of their participation in class discussions. Excellence in these two areas requires completion of assigned readings and regular attendance.
